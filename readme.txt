Deeper - Between a Rock and a Hard Place.

You are an adventurer, a man now hunted by the local king! In your daring escape from the castle keep,
you decided to run from the army chasing you in to a cave. As you descend deeper in to the cave, you
sense that you are not alone. Soon, you trip in to a pit, and tumble down in to a dungeon far worse
that the one you escaped from. With an army at your heels, there's nowhere to go, but deeper.

Deeper is a top down roguelike, with a twist. Instead of using skill checks to determine the outcome of
a fight, instead you use the basic physical principles that govern all motion, momentum! As you
accelerate, you build momentum, and when you crash in to your foes, the further you send them flying,
the more damage you do! Beware, though, for the recoil hurts you too, and it's easy to forget that you
are hurting yourself just as much...

The controls for this game are very simple. You simply click where you want to go, and your hero
accelerates to that point. However, as you accelerate, remember that you also have to consider your
previous velocity. If you go too fast, you might not be able to turn fast enough!

In combat, there are several stats that you have to take into account.

Health: Your total number of hitpoints. Increase this with healing potions. If you lose all of it, you
become deadified.

Damage: A flat bonus to your momentum-based damage. The higher it is, the harder you hit.

Strength: How "beefy" you are. It is used as your mass for momentum calculations.

Speed: Your maximum speed. Just what it says on the box. The faster you move, the harder you hit.

The goal of the game is simple. Go deeper until you can't anymore! When you die, your score is saved
if it made it in to the highscores listing.

There are three types of mobs: 

Goblins: Weak, but quick, these have the highest vision radius, and will follow you the longest.
If you're not careful, they can overwhelm you very easily!

Orcs: Footsoldiers with swords and shields, they are faily meaty, but still quick on their feet. THey 
are average on all fronts.

Ogres: Giant, lumbering brutes. They can't follow you too well, but if you let them catch you, they
pack the biggest punch.

Each of the above has a red circle around them. This circle tells you how much health they have left. 
The smaller the circle, the shorter the range at which they will follow you, and the less health they
have left.

On your travels, you will find items. These are potions, swords, armor, and boots.

Armor makes you heavier, and harder to shove. Swords make you hit harder, adding a flat bonus. Potions
restore your health, and can even make you healthier than nomral. Boots make you run faster, increasing
your maximum speed.
